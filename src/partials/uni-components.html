            Semi-sweet chocolate has a cocoa solid content of 35 to 65%. One of
            the best ways to gain an understanding of this type of chocolate is
            to compare it to a different type of chocolate. Semisweet is darker
            than milk chocolate. In a taste comparison, it has a slightly bitter
            taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter.
